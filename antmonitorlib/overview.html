This document describes and provides examples of how to use AntPCAPLib - a packet capturing
library for Android.

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
    AntMonitor captures all IP traffic coming and out of the device. By using our library you can
    control when to start/stop capturing, intercept IP packets, inspect them for strings of interest
    (DPI), and log them on disk for uploading to
    your server at a later time.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="#diagram">Figure 1</a> shows the system overview. The yellow boxes show which classes
    are made available within the library for you to use and extend. The rest of the diagram
    shows how these classes interact with library internals. Below you will find a step-by-step
    guide on how to use our library.

<h1>Examples</h1>

<h4>Starting/Stopping AntMonitor</h4>

<p>
    AntMonitor intercepts traffic by establishing an internal VPN connection. This connection is maintained by a
    VPN service which runs in the background. You can control this service by <em>binding</em> to it. For more information
    about Bounded Services, refer to the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services.html">Android API Guides</a>.

    <br><br>
    AntPCAPLib allows you to bind and control the VPN service through the
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/vpn/VpnController.html">VpnController</a> class. In order to instantiate the VpnController, you need
    a <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html">Context</a> object that also implements the
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/AntMonitorActivity.html">AntMonitorActivity</a> interface.
    The following snippet shows how to instantiate the VpnController and bind to the VPN service
    from a typical Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html">Activity</a>:
</p>

<div style="padding-left: 5%">
    <pre class="brush:java">
        public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements AntMonitorActivity {
            private VpnController mVpnController;

            {@literal @}Override
            protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
                super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

                // Initialize the controller
                mVpnController = VpnController.getInstance(this);
            }

            {@literal @}Override
            protected void onStart() {
                super.onStart();

                // bind to the VPN service
                mVpnController.bind();
            }
        }
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
    Note that returning from the mVpnController.bind() call does not mean that the binding is finished.
    When the binding process has finished, the
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/AntMonitorActivity.html#onVpnStateChanged-edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.vpn.VpnState-">
        onVpnStateChanged(VpnState)</a> callback will be invoked. At this point, you are almost ready
    to establish the VPN connection.

    <br><br>
    For security reasons, the Android OS does not allow apps to establish VPN connections without
    getting user authorization. The following call checks to see if the user has granted VPN rights:

<div style="padding-left: 5%">
    <pre class="brush:java">
        // MainActivity is the Activity from the previous code snippet
        Intent intent = android.net.VpnService.prepare(MainActivity.this);
    </pre>
</div>

If the call returns a non-null object, that means the user has not yet granted VPN rights. In
this case, we must ask the user for VPN rights with the following call:

<div style="padding-left: 5%">
    <pre class="brush:java">
        // intent is the intent from the previous code snippet
        if (intent != null) {
            // Ask user for VPN rights. If they are granted,
            // onActivityResult will be called with RESULT_OK
            startActivityForResult(intent, 0);
        } else {
            // VPN rights were granted before - you can attempt a connection (next example)
        }
    </pre>
</div>

<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#startActivityForResult(android.content.Intent, int)">
    startActivityForResult(intent, 0)</a> will create a prompt for the user, asking her for
VPN rights. If the user agrees, your activity's
<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onActivityResult(int, int, android.content.Intent)">
    onActivityResult(int, int, android.content.Intent)</a> method will be invoked. In our case,
we only care about the second parameter, which indicates whether or not the user agreed.
If the user agreed, then you can proceed with the VPN connection establishment.

<br><br>
The following snippet checks if the user agreed, and if so, establishes the connection:
</p>

<div style="padding-left: 5%">
    <pre class="brush:java">
    protected void onActivityResult(int request, int result, Intent data) {
        // Check if the user granted us rights to VPN
        if (result == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
            // If so, we can attempt a connection
            mVpnController.connect(null, null, null, null);
        }
    }
    </pre>
</div>

<p>
    Calling mVpnController.connect(...) does not mean that VPN is connected. The VPN is connected when the
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/vpn/VpnState.html#CONNECTED">VpnState.CONNECTED</a>
    state is received by
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/AntMonitorActivity.html#onVpnStateChanged-edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.vpn.VpnState-">
        onVpnStateChanged(VpnState)</a>.

    <br><br>
    You may have noticed that <code>mVpnController.connect(...)</code> takes on 4 parameters.
    These parameters can be <code>null</code>, or they can be used to pass various objects that process both real-time
    and off-line traffic. The next two examples illustrate these use cases.
</p>

<h4>Real-Time (On-line) Traffic Processing</h4>

<p>
    AntPCAPLib allows you to read, modify, and block packets before they are sent to
    their intended destinations. To take advantage of this functionality, you simply need to extend
    either the <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/vpn/OutPacketFilter.html">OutPacketFilter</a>
    or the <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/vpn/IncPacketFilter.html">IncPacketFilter</a>
    class, for outgoing or incoming packets, respectively.

    Within you child class, simply override the
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/vpn/PacketFilter.html#acceptIPDatagram-java.nio.ByteBuffer-">
        acceptIPDatagram(ByteBuffer)</a> method. You can do various processing of the packet inside
    the <code>acceptIPDatagram(ByteBuffer)</code> function and you can even block packets by
    returning a <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/logging/PacketAnnotation.html">
    PacketAnnotation</a> that was initialized with <code>allowPacket</code> set to <code>false</code>.

    <br><br>
    AntPCAPLib also intercepts TLS traffic and decrypts the packets whenever possible.
    In such cases, the decrypted packet is passed to a packet filter via the
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/vpn/PacketFilter.html#acceptDecryptedSSLPacket-java.nio.ByteBuffer-java.lang.String-int-int-short-">
        acceptDecryptedSSLPacket(...)</a> function call.

    <br><br>
    <b>Important Note:</b> Decrypted SSL packets are passed to both
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/vpn/PacketFilter.html#acceptIPDatagram-java.nio.ByteBuffer-">
        acceptIPDatagram(ByteBuffer)</a> and
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/vpn/PacketFilter.html#acceptDecryptedSSLPacket-java.nio.ByteBuffer-java.lang.String-int-int-short-">
        acceptDecryptedSSLPacket(...)</a>.

    <br><br>
    To ensure that the AntMonitor Library uses your filters, you must pass them as arguments to the
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/vpn/VpnController.html#connect-edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.vpn.PacketFilter-edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.vpn.PacketFilter-edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.logging.PacketConsumer-edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.logging.PacketConsumer-">
        VpnController.connect(...)</a> call.

    <a href="../../ant_sdk_example/app/src/main/java/edu/uci/calit2/antexample/ExamplePacketFilter.java">
        ExamplePacketFilterOut</a> is an example of an
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/vpn/OutPacketFilter.html">OutPacketFilter</a>
    implementation. You can use this filter by passing it to
    <code>VpnController</code> like so ("this" is an Activity or some other Context):

<div style="padding-left: 5%">
    <pre class="brush:java">
        ExamplePacketFilterOut outFilter = new ExamplePacketFilterOut(this);
        mVpnController.connect(null, outFilter, null, null);
    </pre>
</div>

Note that in the above snippet, no incoming filter is provided.

<br><br>
<b>Important Note:</b> Although you can map packets to apps and log them inside a
<code>PacketFilter</code>, we do not recommend that you do so, as it may slow down network
throughput since these filters act on real-time traffic. Instead, offload any heavy processing
to implementations of the
<a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/logging/PacketConsumer.html">PacketConsumer</a> class.
See the next example for more details about this class.
</p>

<h4>Off-line Traffic Processing</h4>

<p>
    To allow you to perform CPU and/or I/O intensive operations on packets, AntPCAPLib
    saves all packets to a queue. Elements of the queue are consumed by a different thread so as not
    to interfere with the main network threads. Whenever an element is available,
    AntPCAPLib calls
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/logging/PacketConsumer.html#consumePacket-edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.util.PacketDumpInfo-">
        consumePacket(PacketDumpInfo)</a>. To use this feature, simply extend the
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/logging/PacketConsumer.html">PacketConsumer</a> class.

    <br><br>
    <a href="../../ant_sdk_example/app/src/main/java/edu/uci/calit2/antexample/ExamplePacketConsumer.java">
        ExamplePacketConsumer</a> is an example of a
    <code>PacketConsumer</code> implementation. Pass it to
    <code>VpnController</code> like so:

<div style="padding-left: 5%">
    <pre class="brush:java">
        ExamplePacketConsumer incConsumer =
                new ExamplePacketConsumer(this, TrafficType.INCOMING_PACKETS,
                                            "userId");

        ExamplePacketConsumer outConsumer =
                new ExamplePacketConsumer(this, TrafficType.OUTGOING_PACKETS,
                                            "userId");

        mVpnController.connect(incFilter, outFilter, incConsumer, outConsumer);
    </pre>
</div>

Note that in the above snippet, the same <code>PacketConsumer</code> implementation is used for
both incoming and outgoing packets, but they can be different.
</p>

<h4>Uploading Logged Data</h4>

<p>
    If your <code>PacketConsumer</code> uses the
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/logging/PacketConsumer.html#log-edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.util.PacketDumpInfo-edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.logging.ConnectionValue-">
        log(PacketDumpInfo, ConnectionValue)</a> function to log packet data in PCAPNG format,
    you can access these files at any time by calling
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/logging/TrafficLogFiles.html#getCompleted-android.content.Context-">
        TrafficLogFiles.getCompleted(android.content.Context)</a>. You can then upload them to your
    server, delete them, etc.

    <br><br>
    If you are using our LogServer code, you can upload the logged files to LogServer by using the
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/antmonitor/lib/logging/FileUploader.html">FileUploader</a> class:

<div style="padding-left: 5%">
    <pre class="brush:java">
        FileUploader uploader = new FileUploader(context, R.raw.certificate,
                                        SERVER_ADDRESS, SERVER_SECRET, userID);
        int failures = uploader.upload();
        Log.d(TAG, "Upload finished. Number of failed uploads = " + failures);
    </pre>
</div>

For security reasons, not all variables are shown in the above snippet. Your server will
be configured by you, and thus you will have all the information that you need to initialize
the <code>FileUploader</code>. Key parameters to note:

<ul>
    <li>R.raw.certificate: the SSL certificate used by your server. You can store it
        as a raw resource in your app. </li>
    <li>SERVER_ADDRESS: the address of your server, such as, "https://128.195.185.110:443/"</li>
    <li>SERVER_SECRET: the apiKey used by your LogServer. </li>
</ul>
