This is a developer's guide for AntMonitorLib. It assumes that you are already familiar with
the basic goals of the AntMonitor project. If not, please visit the
<a href="https://athinagroup.eng.uci.edu/projects/antmonitor">project website</a> and see our latest papers.
<br>
This guide also assumes that you are familiar with the API overview of the
<a href="https://uci-networking-group.github.io/AntMonitorExample/">AntMonitorLib</a>.

<h1 id="significant-packages-and-classes">Significant Packages and Classes</h1>
<p>
    The library is meant to provide a hook into all IP traffic of an Android device. It does so
    by establishing an on-device VPN connection. The class responsible for routing traffic is the
    {@link edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.vpn.ForwarderManager}. Packets
    sent by other apps arrive at the TUN interface, are read by the
    {@link edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.vpn.ForwarderManager}, are
    forwarded for real-time analysis, and are then sent out to the Internet over a protected socket.
    Responses are read from the socket, are subjugated to real-time analysis, and are then sent
    back to the apps over the TUN interface.
</p>
<p>
    Because packets read from TUN are Layer-3 (IP) packets and Java sockets operate on Layer-4
    (TCP/UDP), {@link edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.vpn.ForwarderManager}
    needs to perform a translation between these two layers and keep track of TCP states.
    An example of how a TCP connection is setup is shown in <a href="#translation">Figure 1</a>.
    For more details, see the processPacket(packet) method of
    {@link edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.vpn.TCPForwarder}.

<h1>Mapping of Packets to Apps</h1>
<p>
    In both offline and online analysis, library users can invoke an API call to map a given
    packet to an app that was responsible for sending or receiving it.
    The mapping to app names is done by looking up
    the packets' source and destination IPs and port numbers in
    the list of active connections available in <code>/proc/net</code>, which
    provides the UIDs of apps responsible for each connection. This look-up is implemented in
    native C to optimize the performance. The corresponding file can be found in
    <code>antmonitorlib/src/main/jni/connectionMapper.cpp</code>.
    Given a UID returned from the C code, we get the corresponding package name using Android APIs.
    <br><br>

    The class responsible for invoking the mapping and communicating with the native C code is
    {@link edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.logging.ConnectionFinder}.
</p>

<h1>TLS Interception</h1>

<p>
    To allow library users to inspect encrypted traffic, the library implements a TLS proxy, as
    shown in <a href="#block-diagram">Figure 2</a>. TLS connections are first forwarded to
    {@link edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.vpn.TLSProxyServer}, which handles each connection on
    a separate thread. Currently, two threads are created per TLS/SSL connection. The threads are
    maintained by {@link edu.uci.calit2.antmonitor.lib.vpn.TLSProxyForwarder}, which is where
    the packets get decrypted, sent for analysis, and then re-encrypted before being forwarded
    to the Internet.<br><br>

    The TLS proxy uses the <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/sandrop/">SandroProxy</a>
    library, and a modified version of parts of the
    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Near/privacyguard">PrivacyGuard code</a>.
    Upon install time, library users can invoke an API call to ask the user to install a root
    certificate. This certificate, by default, is trusted by all other apps.
    When an app wants to establish a secure connection, the SSL hello is intercepted by the proxy, as
    shown in <a href="#tls-fig">Figure 3</a>.
    The proxy then sends a fake certificate back to the app, which is signed by
    the root certificate that was installed by the user. The app and the proxy then finish negotiating
    keys using the fake certificate, and the proxy and the server exchange keys using the actual server
    certificate. Once the key exchange is complete, the proxy can successfully decrypt packets coming
    in from the app and from the server, and then re-encrypt them before forwarding. This method
    works for most apps, but it cannot intercept traffic from highly sensitive apps, such as banking
    apps, that use certificate pinning. These apps only trust locally stored certificates, and will
    not trust the installed root certificate. Due to the intrusive nature of intercepting TLS/SSL
    traffic, we allow library users to disable this option at any time.

<h1>Building the Library</h1>
<p>
    The library gets built alongside the AntClient app and is outputted into
    <code>antmonitorlib/build/outputs/aar</code>.
